It is a paradox because it contradicts basic geometric intuition: You should not be able construct two balls from the *material* in a single ball. 

However, from a mathematical perspective, there is a clear explanation for this: The key is in the word 'material,' there is not an infinite number of atoms in a bowling ball, but the canonical mathematical definition of a ball  is of a [convex space](Convexity) in which the space making up a ball is continuous. This, in turn, sets the trap of [[Measure Theory|measure theory]], as assigning a non-zero measure to every subspace will lead to contradictions like this. This is the foundation to why we need [[Probability Theory#Sigma Fields|sigma fields]] over which to define our [[Probability Theory|probabilities]].

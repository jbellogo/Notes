A function from sample space to real line. 


# Discrete
A discrete [[Random Variable]] is characterized by its **probability mass function**. 

A **pmf**, $f_X$ is such that:

$$f_X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}} $$
$$ \sum_{x \in \Omega} f_X(x)=1 $$
  

# Continuous
A continuous RV is characterized by its **probability distribution function**. A pdf $f_Y$ is such that:

$$ f_Y : \Omega=\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}} $$

$$ \int_{\Omega} f_Y(y) dy =1  $$

The sample space for cts rv's is often the reals.

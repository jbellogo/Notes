A function from sample space to real line. 


A discrete RV is characterized by its probability \textbf{mass} function. A \textbf{pmf} $f_X$ is such that:

\[f_X : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}} \]

\[\sum_{x \in \Omega} f_X(x)=1 \]

  

  

A continuous RV is characterized by its probability \textbf{distribution} function. A \textbf{pdf} $f_Y$ is such that:

\[f_Y : \Omega=\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R_{\geq 0}} \]

\[\int_{\Omega} f_Y(y) dy =1 \]

The sample space for cts rv's is often the reals.

Collection of [[Stochastic Processes]] whose effect of the past on the future is summarized only by the current state. These ones are more manageable than  those depending on entire path evolution like [[Options#Asian]]
  

Formally: A [[Stochastic Processes|discrete time stochastic process]] $X_1, X_2, \dots$ is a **markov chain** if: 

$$P(X_{t+1}=s | X_0, X_1, \dots , X_t) = P(X_{t+1}=s | X_t)$$

## Independence of Random Variables

For a sequence of RV's $X_1, X_2, \dots X_n$there are two principal notions of independence: 

* Mutual independence: independence property satisfied for all subsets of ${X_i}_{1<i<n}$. This is the notion of absolute independence we are often interested in.
* Pairwise independence: independence property satisfied only for pairs.


# Independence of variates
It's impossible to test for independence without the joint probability distribution, so in the context of statistics, and more specifically [[Forecasting]], we will test for consequences of independence like  uncorrelatedness ie just the lack of a linear relationship, not the lack of any relationship at all. We know correlation -> dependence so we will run a blood test to make sure nothing is seriously wrong.

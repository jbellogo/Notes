## Independence of Random Variables

For a sequence of RV's $X_1, X_2, \dots X_n$there are two principal notions of independence: 

\begin{itemize}

\item Mutual independence: independence property satisfied for all subsets of ${X_i}_{1<i<n}$.** \textbf{This is the one we are interested in.}

\item Pairwise independence: independence property satisfied only for pairs.

\end{itemize}

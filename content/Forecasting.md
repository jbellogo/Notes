1. Pick a model, 
2. then residual diagnostics to evaluate fit and model assumptions, i.e. $N(0,\sigma)$ normality or residuals 
3. if residual diagnostics pass you THEN do inference (prediction, confidence intervals, p-values). 


\item $Cov(X_i, X_j) = 0$ for uncorrelated RVs

\item for two RVs, Independence is a stronger condition than non-correlation

\item WHAT ARE DEGREES OF FREEDOM?

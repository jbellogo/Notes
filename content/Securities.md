# Positions

## Long  

held by the holder (=buyer) of an option.

*If you are long on a stock, you have an optimistic view on the underlying* 

$$\text{PAYOUT}_t = S_0 - S_t$$

You believe the stock will appreciate in value, optimistic about it, so you want to own it to sell later, or have the right to buy at a later date for a strike price you believe will be under the price at that time.

Lending (depositing) money to the bank BUYING a bond form the bank (Long)

##  Short
The writer (seller) of an option holds the short position.

"Short sell it" = "Bet against it"

Payout:
$$PAYOUT = S_0 - S_T$$

When a rational agent shorts a stock, he hopes to sell high first and then buy low, ie $S_T < S_0$. 
- If the stock drops to zero, your profit is 100% of the selling price​. 
- However, if the stock rises indefinitely, your potential loss is unbounded.
### Technicalities
Shorting a stock requires upfront capital—you can’t simply promise to return it later and take the money out of thin air.

1. You borrow the shares of a stock today from someone who owns it, a financial intermediary/broker lets you do this without even notifying the true owner. 
2. You sell the stock at todays price: $+S_0$
3. At maturity, you must buy the stock to repay it to the owner at current price: $-S_T$.

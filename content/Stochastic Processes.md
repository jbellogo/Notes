A *stochastic process* is a sequence of random variables indexed by set A, $(X_{\alpha})_{\alpha \in A}$. We can get creative with set A, in a [[Time series]] it will be time but in a [[poisson process]] it can take a 'spatial meaning. The set A gives the sequence *structure* through the mathematical structures in the set A such as ordering, closures, etc. 

Examples of stochastic processes: 

* Markov Chain
* Martingale 
* Poisson Process 
* Time series 
* Empirical Process

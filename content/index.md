title: Juan's Notes
---
These Computational Math notes are primarily compiled from my coursework at the University of Waterloo.

Iâ€™m currently transcribing my old notes from .tex format. Since this involves revisiting and reorganizing topics, the notes currently focus on [[Probability Theory]], [[Game Theory]], and [[Options]]. However, the goal is to use Obsidian to consolidate all my math notes, which will continue to grow over time.

# Current Focus

- [[Options]]

## These are my notes

>“When I was young, math was like a faraway land surrounded by giant walls that I could not climb... I dreamed of becoming a poet to express the inexpressible. I eventually learned that mathematics is a way of doing that.”

I’m a **Mathematics** graduate from the University of Waterloo, passionate about tackling challenging problems at the intersection of **software and mathematics**.

These Computational Math notes are primarily compiled from my coursework at the University of Waterloo.


> [!note] Note on Notes
> I'm transcribing my old notes from .tex format, revisiting and reorganizing topics as I go. The notes are currently incomplete and primarily focus on [[Probability Theory]], [[Statistics]], and [[Options]]. However, my goal is to consolidate all my math notes in Obsidian, which will continue to grow over time.


# Current Focus

- [[Probability Theory]]

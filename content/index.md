These Computational Math notes are primarily compiled from my coursework at the University of Waterloo.

I’m currently transcribing my old notes from .tex format. Since this involves revisiting and reorganizing topics, the notes currently focus on [[Probability Theory]], [[Game Theory]], and [[Options]]. However, the goal is to use Obsidian to consolidate all my math notes, which will continue to grow over time.

# Current Focus

- [[Options]]

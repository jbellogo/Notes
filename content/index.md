I’m a **Mathematics** graduate from the University of Waterloo, passionate about tackling challenging problems at the intersection of **software and mathematics**.



> [!note] Note on Notes
> I'm transcribing my old notes from .tex format, revisiting and reorganizing topics as I go. The notes are currently incomplete and primarily focus on [[Probability Theory]] and [[Options]], with [[Game Theory]] and [[Statistics]] coming soon. However, my goal is to consolidate all my math knowledge in Obsidian, which will continue to grow over time.

## Why Obsidian?

Since I started jiujitsu, I realized that knowledge is best applied when it is well-organized. As an aspiring mathematician, it seemed natural to structure my own thoughts, interpretations, and structures—flawed as they may be— in an organized manner. 

>[!tip] Homomorphisms
>Jiujitsu is a highly technical martial art that relies on a deep understanding of various positions, which can be effectively organized as nodes in a directed [[Graphs|graph]]. Transitions between these positions occur with success probabilities: $p$ representing the offensive player's progression and $1−p$  representing the defender's successful resistance. Taking this idea further, jiujitsu can be modeled as a [[Markov Chains]], forming a graph symmetric around a set of 50/50 neutral positions, with terminal absorbing states corresponding to submissions that mark the end of the match. With this representation, you could even formulate it as a [[Strategic Games|strategic game]]... but more on that later."

## Why "homomorphisms"?
We may live different lives, but we encounter the same underlying themes. These similarities are everywhere—that is the essence of abstraction, the foundation of mathematics.


## Current Focus

- [[Probability Theory]]

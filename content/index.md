## Hi there, I'm Juan 👋

I’m a **Mathematics** graduate from the University of Waterloo, passionate about tackling challenging problems at the intersection of **software and mathematics**.


### In The Past

- I interned at [Versa Networks](https://versa-networks.com/) as a ***cloud developer***, working on ==cybersecurity microservices==  within an API-driven data protection cluster.
- I also interned at [Catalyst Technologies](https://catalystreaction.com/) as a ***backend developer***, contributing to the integration of ==blockchain technologies in the agricultural industry== by facilitating carbon rebates for environmentally friendly farming practices.
- I worked at [SYMX.AI](https://symx.ai/), leveraging AWS technologies and communication protocols to ==integrate IoT functionality into mining drills==, enhancing operator training and improving mechanical efficiency through data-driven cloud analytics.


### Fun Facts
- I absolutely love martial arts and have recently participated in over 30 [grappling competitions](https://smoothcomp.com/en/profile/769884).
- I work part-time supporting people with mental disabilities at a non-profit organization called [L'Arche](https://larche.ca/).

> [!note] Note on Notes
> I'm transcribing my old notes from .tex format, revisiting and reorganizing topics as I go. The notes are currently incomplete and primarily focus on [[Probability Theory]] and [[Options]], with [[Game Theory]],  [[Statistics]], and [[Enumeration]] coming soon. My goal is to consolidate all my math knowledge in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which will continue to grow over time. Also, If a link doesn’t work, it’s likely because I haven’t written anything for it yet. This is a work in progress.

## Why Obsidian?

Since I started jiujitsu, I realized that ==knowledge is best applied when it is well-organized.== As an aspiring mathematician, it seemed natural to structure my own thoughts, interpretations, and structures—flawed as they may be— in an organized manner. 

>[!tip] Homomorphisms
>Jiujitsu is a highly technical martial art that relies on a deep understanding of various positions, which can be effectively organized as nodes in a directed [[Graphs|graph]]. Transitions between these positions occur with success probabilities: $p$ representing the offensive player's progression and $1−p$  representing the defender's successful resistance. Taking this idea further, jiujitsu can be modeled as a [[Markov Chains]], forming a graph symmetric around a set of 50/50 neutral positions, with terminal absorbing states corresponding to submissions that mark the end of the match. With this representation, you could even formulate it as a [[Strategic Games|strategic game]]... but more on that later."

## Why "homomorphisms"?


We may live different lives, but we encounter the same underlying themes. These similarities are everywhere—that is the essence of abstraction, the foundation of mathematics.


## Current Focus

- [[Probability Theory]]
